Inspired by Evan Czaplicki's theory of
[Convergent Evolution](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HRJ_VjkmyiE&t=4802s),
and following [the Elm Tutorial](https://guide.elm-lang.org) as a guide,
we implement the same examples in React/Redux/ImmutableJS in order to explore:

- how The Elm Architecture parallels React/Redux
- how Elm "microapps" might interop with a React/Redux architecture
- how to write better React/Redux code

> If you are on the fence, I can safely guarantee that if you
> give Elm a shot and actually make a project in it, you will
> end up writing better JavaScript and React code.
> The ideas transfer pretty easily! â€” _Evan Czaplicki_

Here are some discoveries of similarities/differences between Elm
and React/Redux:

- Types, of course.  It would be interesting to repeat this exercise in Typescript or Flow.
